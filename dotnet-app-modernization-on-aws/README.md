# .NET App Modernization on AWS — AI-DLC Starter Pack

A **tool-agnostic** starter pack for **modernizing .NET applications onto AWS**, built on the **AI-Driven Development Lifecycle (AI-DLC)** decision-driven workflow.

The pack is authored once as tool-neutral source and works with **Kiro, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, and Cursor**. Whichever agent you use picks up the instructions automatically and follows a structured, decision-gated workflow — it never writes a spec document until you have filled in your decisions first.

## Use case

Take an existing **.NET application** — typically **ASP.NET Framework on Windows/IIS** — and modernize it for AWS. The pack's default arc is:

**Reverse-engineer the legacy app → (optionally) run AWS Transform for .NET (Framework → Core) → stabilize the transformed app → externalize session state & configuration → containerize → deploy to Amazon ECS Fargate (Linux) → instrument with OpenTelemetry/ADOT → harden & review.**

This is a **brownfield-first** pack: because modernization assumes existing code, the workflow runs **Phase 0 (reverse engineering) by default**, and — uniquely — it will **ingest any pre-existing AWS Transform (ATX) analysis** it finds and fold it into the analysis rather than starting from scratch. It still degrades gracefully to a greenfield "reimagine" build when no prior code exists.

## Getting started

Pick **one** of the two ways to add this pack to your project.

### Option A — copy a pre-built folder (no tooling)

Pre-generated, tool-correct configs live under [`scaffolded-packs/`](scaffolded-packs/). Copy the folder for your tool into your project root:

| Your tool | Copy from | Into your project |
|---|---|---|
| **Kiro** | `scaffolded-packs/kiro/` | `.kiro/` |
| **Claude Code** | `scaffolded-packs/claude-code/` | `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/`, `.mcp.json` |
| **GitHub Copilot** | `scaffolded-packs/copilot/` | `.github/`, `.vscode/mcp.json` |
| **Cursor** | `scaffolded-packs/cursor/` | `.cursor/` |

### Option B — generate it (installer)

Run the `ramp-pack` installer from the repo root; it reads the neutral source and writes the correct layout into your target project:

```bash
node installer/bin/ramp-pack.js init dotnet-app-modernization-on-aws --tool <kiro|claude-code|copilot|cursor> --target /path/to/your/project
```

Add `--dry-run` to preview, `--force` to overwrite existing files. Option B always works even if `scaffolded-packs/` is missing or out of date — the neutral source is the single source of truth.

### Then

1. The **AWS Knowledge MCP** (default-on) needs no credentials. The bundled **AWS MCP Server** (`aws-mcp-server`) ships **disabled** — enable it in the generated MCP config if you want it. Configure an AWS profile for any live AWS operations (Aurora DSQL MCP, deployments).
2. (Optional) If you have **AWS Transform / ATX** analysis for your app, drop it in the workspace (or note its path) — the reverse-engineering phase will detect and reuse it.
3. Open the project in your tool and start a conversation. Try:
   - *"I want to modernize this ASP.NET Framework app onto AWS ECS Fargate. Let's start the AI-DLC workflow."*
   - On Claude Code / Copilot you can also run the **`/aidlc`** command to kick off the workflow.

The workflow runs reverse engineering first (brownfield default), then creates `_decisions-requirements.md` and waits for your input before writing `requirements.md`. The same gate applies before `design.md` and `tasks.md`. Every decision is appended to `aidlc-docs/audit.md`, and progress is tracked in `aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md` so you can resume across sessions. The spec bundle and `aidlc-docs/` are created by the agent on the first run — specs land in **`.kiro/specs/`** on Kiro and in a root **`specs/`** folder on Claude Code / Copilot / Cursor; `aidlc-docs/` is always at the project root.

## How the workflow works

Every phase is **decision-gated**: the agent writes a `_decisions-*.md`, waits for your input, then generates the matching spec document.

**Entry (always):**
1. Resume from `aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md` if it exists.
2. Detect **brownfield vs greenfield**. Brownfield (this pack's default) → run Phase 0 reverse engineering first; greenfield reimagine → skip it.

**Phase 0 — Reverse Engineering (brownfield):**
- Ingests pre-existing **AWS Transform (ATX)** analysis if present, then scans the codebase.
- Captures .NET-specific modernization signals (target framework, IIS/`web.config`, Windows-only dependencies, session/state, config/secrets, auth).
- Produces analysis docs under `aidlc-docs/analysis/` (architecture, bounded contexts, modernization-readiness, etc.).

**Then the standard flow:**
```
Phase 1 Requirements → Phase 2 Design → Phase 3 Tasks (independent parallel waves) → execute
```
- **Phase 1** — modernization goals, cutover strategy, functional parity, NFRs, migration constraints.
- **Phase 2** — target architecture: transformation path, ECS compute, containerization, state/config externalization, data migration, IaC, observability, identity.
- **Phase 3** — an ordered task plan grouped into independent **waves** that can run in parallel.

**Invariants:** decision-file before every spec doc · real approval gates · skills/MCP activated before design & code · every decision appended to an append-only audit log; progress tracked for session resume.

> `instructions/`, `skills/`, and `pack.yaml` are the **neutral source** you edit. `scaffolded-packs/` is **generated** from them by the installer — regenerate it after editing the source; don't hand-edit the scaffolded output.

### MCP servers

| MCP Server | When the agent uses it |
|---|---|
| **AWS Knowledge** (`aws-knowledge-mcp-server`) | Validate AWS guidance — service limits, quotas, regional availability, current API behavior, resource shapes. |
| **Aurora DSQL** (`aurora-dsql`) | Validate Aurora DSQL schemas, connection patterns, and DSQL-specific semantics (for reimagine/greenfield data targets). |
| **AWS MCP Server** (`aws-mcp-server`) | Broader AWS tooling via `mcp-proxy-for-aws` (`https://aws-mcp.us-east-1.api.aws/mcp`). **Ships disabled** — enable it in the MCP config if you want it. |

### Skills

Curated, domain-specific knowledge bundles the agent activates on demand. They follow the [Agent Skills open standard](https://agentskills.io/) (`<skill>/SKILL.md` + `references/`), so they copy verbatim into every supported tool. See [Credits & attribution](#credits--attribution) for sources and licensing.

> **IaC mix — heads up:** the `dotnet-*` skills generate **CloudFormation or CDK**, while `ecs-build` generates **Terraform**. Pick one IaC tool per project and activate the matching skill; the workflow makes IaC-tool an explicit design decision. `ecs-recon` and `ecs-operation-review` were added beyond the core five ECS skills to round out the discover→…→review lifecycle — remove them if you don't need discovery/audit.

## Prerequisites
