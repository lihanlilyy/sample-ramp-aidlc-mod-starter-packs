# Section 02 — Networking

## Purpose
Assess task network mode, security-group segmentation, subnet IP capacity for `awsvpc` ENIs, private connectivity to AWS services, and service-to-service networking. Grounded in the ECS Best Practices Guide networking pillar and [network security best practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/bestpracticesguide/security-network.html).

## Checks to Execute

### 2.1 — Task Network Mode (awsvpc preferred)

**What to check:**
- `networkMode` in each task definition (`awsvpc`, `bridge`, `host`, `none`).
- Fargate tasks must use `awsvpc` (enforced).

**How to check:**
1. `aws ecs list-task-definitions` → `aws ecs describe-task-definition --task-definition <arn>` → read `networkMode`.

**Rating:**
- 🟢 GREEN: `awsvpc` mode — each task gets its own ENI and can be assigned dedicated security groups.
- 🟡 AMBER: `bridge` mode on EC2 where per-task SG isolation would be valuable.
- 🔴 RED: `host` mode for internet-facing or multi-tenant workloads (shared host network namespace, no per-task SG, port conflicts).
- ⬜ UNKNOWN: Cannot describe task definitions.

**Key talking point:** `awsvpc` is the preferred mode and the only mode that lets you assign security groups per task; it is mandatory for Fargate. See [network security best practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/bestpracticesguide/security-network.html).

### 2.2 — Security Groups per Task / Least-Privilege Ingress

**What to check:**
- Security groups attached via the service's `networkConfiguration.awsvpcConfiguration.securityGroups`.
- Overly-permissive ingress (`0.0.0.0/0` on non-LB ports), or one shared broad SG across all tasks.

**How to check:**
1. `aws ecs describe-services --cluster <c> --services <s>` → `networkConfiguration.awsvpcConfiguration.securityGroups`.
2. `aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids <sg>` → inspect ingress rules.

**Rating:**
- 🟢 GREEN: Task SGs scoped to required ports/sources; ingress from the load balancer SG or specific CIDRs only.
- 🟡 AMBER: One shared SG across dissimilar workloads, or broader ingress than needed.
- 🔴 RED: `0.0.0.0/0` ingress on application ports directly to tasks (bypassing the LB), or wide-open SGs.
- ⬜ UNKNOWN: Cannot read SG rules.

Deep network-isolation hardening → **`ecs-security`**.

### 2.3 — Subnet IP Capacity for awsvpc ENIs

**What to check:**
- Subnets used by services and available IP addresses.
- Whether the subnets have enough free IPv4 to scale to the desired/max task count (each `awsvpc` task consumes at least one ENI IP).

**How to check:**
1. From `awsvpcConfiguration.subnets`, run `aws ec2 describe-subnets --subnet-ids <ids>` → `AvailableIpAddressCount`.
2. Compare against current running task count and autoscaling max.

**Rating:**
- 🟢 GREEN: >30% IP headroom across task subnets relative to max scale.
- 🟡 AMBER: Adequate now but tight relative to autoscaling max.
- 🔴 RED: <15% free IPs, or prior task-launch failures due to subnet IP exhaustion.
- ⬜ UNKNOWN: Cannot determine autoscaling max or subnet sharing with other workloads.

**Key talking point:** Insufficient private IPv4 in task subnets is a common hard stop on scaling `awsvpc`/Fargate tasks — size subnets (e.g., /20s) for peak task count. See [scale to 15,000+ tasks](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/scale-to-15000-tasks-in-a-single-amazon-elastic-container-service-ecs-cluster/).

### 2.4 — Private Connectivity to AWS Services (VPC Endpoints / NAT)

**What to check:**
- Whether tasks in private subnets reach ECR, CloudWatch Logs, Secrets Manager, SSM, etc. via VPC (PrivateLink) endpoints vs a NAT gateway or public egress.
- Presence of interface endpoints: `ecr.api`, `ecr.dkr`, `logs`, `secretsmanager`, `ssm`, and an S3 gateway endpoint (ECR layers).

**How to check:**
1. `aws ec2 describe-vpc-endpoints --filters Name=vpc-id,Values=<vpc>` → enumerate service names.
2. Cross-check against the VPC/subnets the tasks run in.

**Rating:**
- 🟢 GREEN: Interface endpoints for the AWS services tasks use, plus S3 gateway endpoint; private subnets need no internet path for control-plane traffic.
- 🟡 AMBER: Some endpoints present but relying on NAT for others.
- 🔴 RED: Sensitive/regulated workloads egressing to AWS APIs over the public internet with no endpoint policy.
- ⬜ UNKNOWN: Cannot map task subnets to endpoints.

**Key talking point:** AWS PrivateLink interface endpoints keep ECS/ECR/Logs/Secrets traffic on the AWS network and let you attach least-privilege endpoint policies. Note Fargate tasks don't need the ECS interface endpoints themselves, but pulling private ECR images, reading Secrets Manager/SSM secrets, and shipping `awslogs` to CloudWatch each require their own interface endpoints (plus the S3 gateway endpoint for ECR layers) when there's no internet path. Verified 2026-07-09. See [Amazon ECS interface VPC endpoints (AWS PrivateLink)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/vpc-endpoints.html).

### 2.5 — Service-to-Service Networking (Service Connect / VPC Lattice / Service Discovery)

**What to check:**
- Whether inter-service traffic uses **Service Connect** (managed service mesh + discovery + metrics), **VPC Lattice** (cross-VPC/cross-account app networking with IAM-based auth), Service Discovery (Cloud Map), or hardcoded endpoints/internal ALBs.
- For Service Connect: whether **automatic connection draining** is in play so clients switch to new endpoints during deploys without traffic errors.

**How to check:**
1. `aws ecs describe-services --cluster <c> --services <s>` → `serviceConnectConfiguration` (enabled?), `vpcLatticeConfigurations` (VPC Lattice target-group registration), and `serviceRegistries` (Cloud Map).

**Rating (rate whether a discovery mechanism *exists and works*, not whether it matches a preferred product — product selection is `ecs-architect`'s lane):**
- 🟢 GREEN: Inter-service traffic uses a working discovery/connectivity mechanism appropriate to the requirement — Service Connect, VPC Lattice, Cloud Map service discovery, or internal load balancers — with no hardcoded coupling.
- 🟡 AMBER: A discovery mechanism exists but shows an operational gap (e.g., no connection draining where deploy-time errors are observed), or partial coverage across services.
- 🔴 RED: Hardcoded IPs/DNS or cross-service coupling with **no** discovery mechanism at all.
- ⚪ N/A: Single-service estate (no east-west traffic).
- ⬜ UNKNOWN: Cannot read service config.

**Key talking point:** Do **not** down-rate a working design merely because it uses Cloud Map or an internal ALB instead of Service Connect / VPC Lattice — choosing *between* mechanisms for a given topology is a Day-0 architecture decision that belongs to **`ecs-architect`**; route there rather than grading a preference here. For context only: Service Connect provides discovery + a service mesh with standardized metrics/logs, doesn't depend on VPC DNS, and supports automatic connection draining for near-zero-error deploys (intra-cluster east-west); **VPC Lattice** natively integrates with ECS (auto-registers/deregisters task IPs as Lattice targets via the ECS infrastructure IAM role) for cross-VPC/cross-account/cross-compute connectivity. See [Service Connect](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-connect.html) and [native ECS support in VPC Lattice](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/streamline-container-application-networking-with-native-amazon-ecs-support-in-amazon-vpc-lattice/).

### 2.6 — ENI Density & awsvpc Trunking (EC2 `awsvpc` only)

**What to check (EC2 launch type / EC2-ASG capacity providers with `awsvpc` task networking — N/A for Fargate, where each task gets its own ENI automatically):**
- Whether the instance types in use can supply enough ENIs for the desired task density per instance. Each `awsvpc` task consumes an ENI; without **ENI trunking (`awsvpcTrunking`)** the per-instance task count is capped by the instance's default ENI limit, and tasks fail to place with `RESOURCE:ENI`.
- Whether the `awsvpcTrunking` account setting is enabled (it raises ENI-bound task density on supported Linux instance types; applies only to instances launched *after* enabling it, and not to Windows).

**How to check:**
1. `aws ecs list-account-settings --name awsvpcTrunking` → is trunking enabled (account/role/user scope)?
2. Look for `RESOURCE:ENI` in `SERVICE_TASK_PLACEMENT_FAILURE` service events / stopped-task reasons.
3. Cross-check instance-type ENI limits against observed/target tasks-per-instance.

**Rating:**
- 🟢 GREEN: ENI supply comfortably exceeds task density (trunking enabled where density warrants); no `RESOURCE:ENI` failures.
- 🟡 AMBER: Density approaching the ENI limit with trunking off, or trunking not evaluated on dense EC2 nodes.
- 🔴 RED: Observed `RESOURCE:ENI` placement failures on production capacity.
- ⚪ N/A: Fargate-only estate, or non-`awsvpc` network mode.
- ⬜ UNKNOWN: Cannot read account settings or service events.

**Key talking point:** On EC2 with `awsvpc`, ENI availability — not just CPU/memory — bounds how many tasks fit on an instance; `RESOURCE:ENI` is the tell. Enable the `awsvpcTrunking` account setting to raise the per-instance ENI limit on supported instance types. See [ECS account settings (ENI trunking)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-account-settings.html) and [elastic network interface trunking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/container-instance-eni.html).
