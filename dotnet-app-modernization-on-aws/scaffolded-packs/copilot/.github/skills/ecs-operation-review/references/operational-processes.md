# Section 08 — Operational Processes

## Purpose
Assess operational maturity: IaC provenance, tagging discipline, disaster-recovery/backup, Fargate task-retirement awareness, and process readiness (runbooks, on-call). Much of this is **not fully detectable from estate state** — those items are marked UNKNOWN with specific questions to investigate.

## Automation Note
The skill detects tool/config presence (IaC tags, backup resources, current health signals). Process maturity (runbooks, on-call rotation, post-incident reviews) cannot be read from the API and is marked UNKNOWN with guidance.

## Checks to Execute

### 8.1 — Infrastructure-as-Code Provenance

**What to check:**
- Cluster/service/task-definition tags indicating IaC management (`aws:cloudformation:stack-name`, `terraform`, `managed-by`, `aws:cdk:*`).
- Whether services are recreatable from code.

**How to check:**
1. `aws ecs describe-clusters --include TAGS` and `aws ecs list-tags-for-resource --resource-arn <service-arn>` → inspect tags.

**Rating:**
- 🟢 GREEN: Clear IaC provenance (CloudFormation/CDK/Terraform tags) across cluster and services.
- 🟡 AMBER: IaC tags on some resources but not all, or unclear if current, **or** no IaC provenance at all (estate appears console/CLI-created and not reproducible).
- ⬜ UNKNOWN: Tags alone can't confirm the code is pipeline-applied vs manually run — suggest user verify.

**Severity cap:** this is a **process/hygiene** finding — cap it at **AMBER** and place it in "Important", never "Critical" (see `report-generation.md`, Step 5). Lack of IaC provenance is important but is not a same-30-day-window emergency the way a single-AZ prod service is.

**Investigate manually:** Is IaC applied via CI/CD or manually? Could you recreate a service from code today?

### 8.2 — Tagging & Environment Classification

**What to check:**
- Consistent `Environment`/`env`, ownership, and cost-allocation tags on clusters and services.

**How to check:**
1. Inspect tags from 8.1 for environment and ownership keys.

**Rating:**
- 🟢 GREEN: Consistent environment + ownership tags enabling clear scoping and cost allocation.
- 🟡 AMBER: Partial/inconsistent tagging, **or** no environment/ownership tags at all (can't cleanly distinguish prod from non-prod or attribute cost/ownership).
- ⬜ UNKNOWN: Cannot read tags.

**Severity cap:** this is a **process/hygiene** finding — cap it at **AMBER** and place it in "Important", never "Critical" (see `report-generation.md`, Step 5). A missing `Environment` tag is not the same blast radius as a single-AZ production service.

**Note:** Consistent env tags also improve the accuracy of every other section's production-vs-non-production rating.

### 8.3 — Disaster Recovery & Backup

**What to check:**
- Backup coverage for stateful data attached to tasks (EFS backups via AWS Backup, EBS snapshots, database backups).
- Multi-Region / multi-AZ posture for critical services.

**How to check:**
1. Identify stateful workloads (EFS/EBS volumes in task definitions).
2. `aws backup list-backup-plans` (best-effort) and check for relevant selections.

**Rating:**
- 🟢 GREEN: Backups configured and (ideally) restore-tested for stateful data; DR posture matches RTO/RPO.
- 🟡 AMBER: Backups exist but never tested, or only partial coverage.
- 🔴 RED: Stateful workloads with no backup strategy.
- ⚪ N/A: Stateless estate with all config in Git/IaC.
- ⬜ UNKNOWN: Cannot determine restore testing — suggest user verify.

### 8.4 — Fargate Task Retirement / Maintenance Awareness

**What to check (Fargate services) — retirement-specific angle only.** Replica count, `minimumHealthyPercent`/`maximumPercent`, and AZ spread are **scored in 4.4 / 5.4 / 5.5**, not here; this check reuses those observed ratings as inputs and scores only what is unique to task retirement:
- **Actually read the running `platformVersion`.** `aws ecs describe-services` → service `platformVersion` (and `platformFamily`); `aws ecs describe-tasks` → per-task `platformVersion`.
- Whether the team is **aware** of Fargate task retirement (AWS periodically replaces tasks on outdated platform-version revisions) and has designed for it — i.e., whether the 4.4/5.4/5.5 posture would absorb a forced single-task replacement without impact.

**How to check:**
1. `aws ecs describe-services` / `describe-tasks` → `platformVersion` per service and per task.
2. Cross-reference the already-recorded 4.4 (capacity bounds), 5.4 (autoscaling/min capacity), and 5.5 (AZ posture) ratings — do not re-derive or re-score them.

**Rating (retirement exposure only — do not re-rate replica/AZ/deploy posture here):**
- 🟢 GREEN: Platform version is `LATEST` or current, and the cross-referenced 4.4/5.4/5.5 posture absorbs a retirement-driven replacement transparently.
- 🟡 AMBER: Pinned to an old (non-`LATEST`) platform version, **or** the cross-referenced posture means a forced replacement causes a brief capacity gap (root cause scored at 4.4/5.4/5.5 — annotate as a related finding, per the consistency contract).
- 🔴 RED: Demonstrably old platform version on a critical service whose cross-referenced posture cannot absorb a retirement (e.g., the single-task case RED-rated at 5.4) — a retirement is a full outage. Annotate the shared root cause.
- ⬜ UNKNOWN: Cannot determine service criticality or read platform version.

**Key talking point:** AWS retires Fargate tasks running on outdated **platform-version revisions**; tasks using `LATEST` still run on the revision current at launch time, so they are also retired routinely — pinning to an old explicit version *increases* exposure but is not the only retired population. Design for retirement with multiple replicas and safe deploy bounds so a replacement is invisible. Verified 2026-07-10. See [task retirement and maintenance for Fargate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-maintenance.html).

### 8.5 — Runbooks, On-Call & Post-Incident Review

**What to check (process — not API-detectable):**
- Current health signals that suggest which runbooks should exist (stopped tasks with failure reasons, deployment rollbacks).

**How to check:**
1. `aws ecs list-tasks --desired-status STOPPED` and describe a sample for `stoppedReason` (e.g., `CannotPullContainerError`, `OutOfMemory`, `ResourceInitializationError`).

**Rating:**
- ⬜ UNKNOWN: Runbook/on-call/PIR maturity cannot be read from estate state.

**Investigate manually:**
- Do you have runbooks for `CannotPullContainerError`, OOM task kills, `ResourceInitializationError`, capacity-provider scale-out failures, and deployment rollbacks?
- Is there a formal on-call rotation and escalation path? What AWS Support tier?
- Do you run blameless post-incident reviews and track action items to completion?

**If active failures are found:** cite them as evidence that the corresponding runbooks should exist and be tested.

### 8.6 — Task-Definition Revision Hygiene & Service Quotas

**What to check:**
- Whether stale task-definition revisions accumulate unbounded. Long-lived families can carry thousands of `ACTIVE` revisions, adding noise to `ListTaskDefinitions` and console navigation, and revisions are never cleaned up unless deregistered/deleted deliberately.
- Whether relevant ECS service quotas (e.g., services per cluster, tasks per service, ASG max capacity vs projected peak) are monitored rather than discovered at the limit.

**How to check:**
1. `aws ecs list-task-definitions --family-prefix <family> --status ACTIVE` → count revisions per family; spot-check for thousands of stale revisions. **Paginate** — long-lived families can carry thousands of revisions; use `--max-items`/`--starting-token` (or `--no-paginate` deliberately) and expect ECS API throttling on large estates (back off and retry once, then mark UNKNOWN).
2. `aws ecs list-task-definitions --status INACTIVE` → gauge cleanup backlog.
3. Cross-check ASG max (from Section 01) and Application Auto Scaling max (Section 05) against projected peak.
4. **Quota proximity (executable):** query Service Quotas for the relevant ECS limits and compare current usage against the limit. For example:
   - `aws service-quotas list-service-quotas --service-code ecs` → read quotas such as *Services per cluster*, *Tasks per service*, *Container instances per cluster*. **Fallback:** `list-service-quotas` returns applied quotas, and several of the quotas named here are non-adjustable — if a quota is missing from the output, read the default with `aws service-quotas list-aws-default-service-quotas --service-code ecs` (or `get-aws-default-service-quota --quota-code <code>`). See the [ECS service quotas reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/ecs-service.html).
   - `aws service-quotas get-service-quota --service-code ecs --quota-code <code>` for a specific limit.
   - Compare against observed counts (`aws ecs list-services`, `describe-services` `runningCount`/`desiredCount`, `list-container-instances`). Flag any usage above ~80% of its quota. (`service-quotas` read calls are on the Step-0 allowlist.)

**Rating:**
- 🟢 GREEN: Old revisions pruned (deregistered, and deleted where appropriate); quotas tracked with headroom to peak (usage well under limits).
- 🟡 AMBER: Revisions growing unbounded with no lifecycle process, or quotas checked only ad hoc, or usage approaching (~80%+) a quota.
- 🔴 RED: **Quota already reached / blocking launches** (a genuine availability issue — this specific case may be Critical).
- ⬜ UNKNOWN: Cannot enumerate revisions or quota usage.

**Severity cap:** revision-sprawl and general quota-tracking hygiene are **process/hygiene** findings — cap at **AMBER** / "Important" (see `report-generation.md`, Step 5). The **only** exception is a quota *already blocking task/service launches*, which is a real availability RED and may be Critical.

**Key talking point:** A revision must be **deregistered** (→ `INACTIVE`) before it can be **deleted** (`DeleteTaskDefinition` → `DELETE_IN_PROGRESS`); existing tasks/services referencing an `INACTIVE`/`DELETE_IN_PROGRESS` revision keep running and can still scale. `INACTIVE` revisions currently persist indefinitely, so treat cleanup as a deliberate lifecycle task rather than assuming AWS reclaims them. See [deregistering a task-definition revision](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/deregister-task-definition-v2.html) and [ECS task-definition deletion](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/announcing-amazon-ecs-task-definition-deletion/).
