# Decision-Driven Document Generation Workflow

A general-purpose AI-DLC workflow with an optional **Reverse Engineering**
pre-phase for brownfield projects. Works for greenfield builds, modernization,
and feature additions alike.

## 🚨 CRITICAL: READ THIS BEFORE DOING ANYTHING 🚨

**This workflow overrides default behavior** when the user asks to plan, build,
modernize, or change anything that warrants a spec.

**FORBIDDEN ACTIONS until the appropriate gate is cleared:**

- DO NOT generate `requirements.md`, `design.md`, or `tasks.md` without first creating and completing the matching `_decisions-*.md`
- DO NOT skip the Reverse Engineering phase when an existing codebase is present
- DO NOT proceed past an approval gate without the user's explicit approval

**MANDATORY FIRST ACTIONS (in this exact order):**

1. Check if `aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md` exists — if yes, **resume** from where we left off
2. If no state file exists, create `aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md` and `aidlc-docs/audit.md`
3. Decide if this is **brownfield** (existing code present) or **greenfield** (no existing code)
4. **Brownfield → run a system-level Phase 0 (Reverse Engineering) FIRST.** Its outputs (bounded contexts, coupling, existing API contracts, modernization-readiness) are the primary input to the repo-model/topology decision and the contract catalog. **Greenfield → skip Phase 0.**
5. Decide **spec placement** (e.g. central specs repo) and a *provisional* **mono-vs-multi preference** early — see **`.kiro/steering/multi-repo-projects.md`**. But **defer the detailed repo topology** (exact repos + boundaries): it is finalized in the **System High-Level Design (S2)**, *after* the **System Requirements (S1)** are captured (and after Phase 0 for brownfield). Topology follows bounded contexts + overall requirements — don't lock exact repos/boundaries before them. Topology must be locked before per-repo design.
6. Proceed: Greenfield single-repo/monorepo → **Phase 1** (its Phase 1/2 already capture overall requirements + design in one repo). Multi-repo (domain-grouped/polyrepo) → the two-level flow: **S1 System Requirements → S2 System High-Level Design** (freeze contracts = Wave 0) → **S3 split** the system requirements into per-repo slices → **S4 fan out** to per-repo detailed R→D→T. (Monorepo spanning multiple contract-sharing domains → run S1/S2 lightly with in-repo contracts.)
7. Follow the workflow sequentially with approval gates.

```

Phase 0 runs **once per project** when the project is brownfield, and
informs Phases 1–3.

## Core Principles

### 🚨 MANDATORY DECISION FILE FIRST
Before creating ANY spec document (`requirements.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md`), you MUST:

1. **Create the decision file first**: `_decisions-requirements.md`, `_decisions-design.md`, or `_decisions-tasks.md`
2. **Wait for user input**: Get explicit user decisions before proceeding
3. **Read completed decisions**: Use user choices to generate the final document

**🔒 ABSOLUTE RULE**: NEVER generate `requirements.md`, `design.md`, or `tasks.md` without first creating and completing the corresponding `_decisions-*.md` file.

**Exception**: Skip the decision file ONLY if the user explicitly says "skip the decision file" or "no decisions needed."

### 🌐 LANGUAGE MATCHING
Generate decision files and spec documents in the same language as the user's input prompt. Default to English only if language cannot be determined.

### 💬 NATURAL MESSAGING
**NEVER say**: "According to the rules…", "The steering file indicates…", "Per the guidelines…", "Following the process, I need to…"

**DO say**:
- "To make sure we capture this correctly, let's clarify some key decisions…"
- "Before we lock the design, I'd like to understand your preferences…"
- "I've prepared some decisions to ensure we build exactly what you need."

Present decision files as a natural part of the planning conversation, not as procedural overhead.

### 🔒 DECISION ISOLATION
Each decision file is independent:
- Requirements decisions apply ONLY to `_decisions-requirements.md`
- Design decisions apply ONLY to `_decisions-design.md`
- Tasks decisions apply ONLY to `_decisions-tasks.md`
- **NEVER carry over** preferences between phases without explicit confirmation
- Each phase requires NEW explicit user input

---

## MANDATORY: State Tracking

Maintain `aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md` for session continuity. If it exists at
session start, **resume** from the recorded state.

> **Multi-repo:** keep state **per level** — `aidlc-docs/_platform/aidlc-state.md` for the shared S0–S3 phases, and a separate `aidlc-docs/<repo>/aidlc-state.md` per sub for its S4 fan-out. This keeps parallel branches from colliding on one tracker. See `.kiro/steering/multi-repo-projects.md`.

```markdown
# AI-DLC Workflow State

## Project Info
- **Project Type**: [Greenfield / Brownfield Modernization / Feature on existing system]
- **Repo Model**: [Single-repo / Multi-repo]
- **Spec Placement** (if multi-repo): [Central specs repo / Co-located / Hybrid]
- **Existing Stack** (if brownfield): [e.g., language, framework, database, cloud services]
- **Target Architecture**: [e.g., target platform / runtime / deployment model]
- **Active Spec**: [name of the spec currently being worked on]

## Multi-Repo Progress (only if Repo Model = Multi-repo)
- [ ] S0. (Brownfield only) System-level Phase 0 RE completed — feeds repo topology + contract catalog (run BEFORE freezing topology)
- [ ] S1. System Requirements (Phase 1, whole system)
  - [ ] _decisions-requirements.md created + completed
  - [ ] system requirements.md approved (intent, user stories + ACs, units of work, cross-cutting NFRs)
- [ ] S2. System High-Level Design (Phase 2, whole system)
  - [ ] _decisions-design.md created + completed
  - [ ] system design.md approved (architecture, contract catalog, repo topology unit→repo, auth)
  - [ ] Shared contracts published (OpenAPI / types / event schemas) — the Wave-0 dependency
- [ ] S3. Split into per-repo slices (split.md) — user stories + contract obligations per repo, confirmed with user

### Per-repo detailed specs (S4 — fan-out, from each repo's slice)
| Repo / Component | Requirements | Design | Tasks | Notes |
|------------------|:-----------:|:------:|:-----:|-------|
| [e.g. consumer-bff] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | consumes: engine API |
| [e.g. consumer-spa] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | consumes: consumer-bff API |

## Phase Progress
- [ ] Phase 0: Reverse Engineering (skip if greenfield)
- [ ] Phase 1: Requirements
  - [ ] 1a. _decisions-requirements.md created
  - [ ] 1b. _decisions-requirements.md completed by user
  - [ ] 1c. requirements.md generated and approved
- [ ] Phase 2: Design
  - [ ] 2a. _decisions-design.md created
  - [ ] 2b. _decisions-design.md completed by user
  - [ ] 2c. design.md generated and approved
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks
  - [ ] 3a. _decisions-tasks.md created
  - [ ] 3b. _decisions-tasks.md completed by user
  - [ ] 3c. tasks.md generated and approved
  - [ ] 3d. Task execution

## Current Status
**Phase**: [current phase]
**Status**: [In Progress / Awaiting Approval / Complete]
**Last Updated**: [ISO timestamp]
```

### Checkpoint Rules
- Update `aidlc-state.md` immediately after completing each phase step
- Mark checkboxes `[x]` in the SAME interaction where work is completed
- Record current status so a fresh session can resume correctly

---

## MANDATORY: Audit Logging

Maintain `aidlc-docs/audit.md` as an append-only log.

> **Multi-repo:** audit **per level** too — `aidlc-docs/_platform/audit.md` for shared S0–S3 decisions, and `aidlc-docs/<repo>/audit.md` per sub for its S4 work — so each sub's audit travels with it at repo hand-off.

- ALWAYS append, NEVER overwrite
- Log every user input with complete raw text
- Log every approval/decision with timestamp
- Log every architectural decision with rationale

```markdown
## [Phase Name] — [Step]
**Timestamp**: [ISO timestamp]
**User Input**: "[complete raw input]"
**AI Response**: "[action taken]"
**Decision**: [decision made and rationale]

---
```

---

## MANDATORY: Decision File Format

```markdown
# Decisions: [Phase Name]

> **Instructions:** Review each decision point below. agent recommendations are provided for guidance. Fill in your decisions in the "Answer" sections, then confirm when ready to proceed.

---

## [Decision Category]

### [Specific Decision Point]

**Question:** [Clear question to be answered]

**Why this matters:** [One-sentence explanation of project impact]

**Options:**
1. [Option 1 — Recommended]: [Description with rationale]
2. [Option 2]: [Description]
3. [Option 3]: [Description]
4. Other (please specify): _______________________

**Answer:**

---
```

**Rules:**
- 3–4 concrete options per decision point
- Mark one option as "Recommended" with rationale
- Briefly explain why each decision matters
- For Design and Tasks phases, **reference the previous phase's decisions** explicitly
- **Customize** decision points to the actual project — never use generic boilerplate
- Handle partial responses: acknowledge completed items, prompt for the rest
- If the user does not respond, ask whether to use agent recommendations as defaults
- Validate that all critical decisions have user input before generating the document

---

## Session Continuity

When `aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md` exists at session start:

1. Read the state file to determine current progress
2. Identify the active spec and phase
3. Load all artifacts from completed phases
4. Present a concise resumption message: last completed step, next step
5. Resume from the next incomplete step

---

# PHASE 0: Reverse Engineering (Brownfield Only)

**When to run:** Existing codebase is present in the workspace OR the user
explicitly references an existing system to modernize/extend.

**When to skip:** Greenfield projects with no prior code.

**Rerun behavior:** Always rerun when the brownfield codebase has changed
materially. Stale analysis is worse than no analysis.

### Activation
**MANDATORY**: Load and follow `.kiro/steering/reverse-engineering.md`.

### Outputs (in `aidlc-docs/analysis/`)
- `business-overview.md`
- `architecture.md`
- `code-structure.md`
- `api-documentation.md`
- `component-inventory.md`
- `technology-stack.md`
- `dependencies.md`
- `bounded-contexts.md`
- `modernization-readiness.md` *(coupling, extraction order, blockers)*

### Approval Gate
Present a summary of findings (bounded contexts, key risks, recommended modernization
order). Wait for the user's explicit approval before moving to Phase 1.

Update `aidlc-state.md`. Append to `audit.md`.

---

# PHASE 1: Requirements

**Focus:** WHAT to build — business and non-functional requirements.

### Step 1.1 — Create `_decisions-requirements.md`

Generate a decision file for the spec. Decision categories to consider:

- **Scope & Personas:** Which user stories / personas are in/out of scope?
- **Functional Requirements:** Which capabilities are MVP vs phase 2?
- **Non-Functional Requirements:** Latency, throughput, availability, durability targets
- **Compliance & Security Constraints:** Data residency, encryption, audit, regulatory standards
- **Integration Requirements:** Existing systems the spec must interoperate with (drawn from Phase 0 outputs when available)
- **Deployment Variants:** Cloud-only, hybrid, or on-prem variants the requirements must support

For brownfield work, reference relevant findings in `aidlc-docs/analysis/`.

### Step 1.2 — Wait for User Input
Acknowledge partial responses. Do not invent decisions.

### Step 1.3 — Generate `requirements.md`

Read the completed decisions and generate `requirements.md` covering:
- User stories (with acceptance criteria, EARS where applicable)
- Functional requirements (numbered, testable)
- Non-functional requirements (numbered, measurable)
- Integration requirements with named systems
- Compliance constraints
- Out-of-scope (explicit)

### Approval Gate
Wait for explicit user approval. Update `aidlc-state.md` and `audit.md`.

---

# PHASE 2: Design

**Focus:** HOW to build it — technical architecture for the spec.

### Step 2.1 — Create `_decisions-design.md`

Generate a decision file. Decision categories to consider:

- **Compute & Runtime:** Compute model, runtime/language, framework
- **API & Communication:** API style, sync vs async, eventing pattern, auth strategy
- **Data Architecture:** Data store choice, ownership, migration approach if brownfield
- **Infrastructure & Operations:** IaC tool, environments, deployment strategy
- **Observability:** Logs, metrics, tracing, alarms; structured logging
- **Testing Strategy at Design Level:** Contract tests, property-based tests, simulation tests
- **Correctness Properties Strategy:** Skip / essential only / comprehensive

**Reference:** Phase 1 decisions and Phase 0 analysis (when brownfield).

### Step 2.2 — Wait for User Input

### Step 2.3 — Generate `design.md`

Generate the complete technical design covering:

- **Overview** with rationale tied to requirements
- **Architecture diagram** (Mermaid) — components, data flow, external systems
- **Component design** for each major piece
- **Data model** (entities, schemas, ownership, retention)
- **API contract** (paths, methods, payloads, status codes)
- **Sequence diagrams** (Mermaid) for key flows
- **Cross-cutting concerns** — auth, observability, error handling, security
- **Risks & mitigations**
- **Decision log** — short table linking design choices back to `_decisions-design.md` items

**MANDATORY Mermaid diagrams:**
1. Component / context diagram
2. At least one sequence diagram for the primary happy path
3. Data model / ER diagram (when persistent state exists)

### Approval Gate
Wait for explicit user approval. Update `aidlc-state.md` and `audit.md`.

---

# PHASE 3: Tasks

**Focus:** Ordered, executable plan to build and verify the spec.

### Step 3.1 — Create `_decisions-tasks.md`

Decision categories to consider:

- **Implementation Strategy:** Vertical slice vs horizontal layer; TDD vs test-after; pair vs solo
- **Task Granularity:** Coarse (≤ 10 tasks) vs fine (≤ 30 tasks)
- **Parallel Execution Groups:** How many parallel workers will execute tasks simultaneously? Which task groups have zero shared state and can execute concurrently? (Analyze dependencies and propose independent groups)
- **Testing Strategy at Execution Level:** Test-first / parallel / post-impl; coverage targets
- **Deployment Approach:** Per-task deploy vs end-of-spec deploy; canary vs simple cutover
- **Rollback Granularity:** Per-task rollback vs full rollback
- **CI/CD Maturity Goal:** Manual gate vs automated promotion
- **Definition of Done:** Tests pass + IaC deployed + smoke verified, or stricter

**Reference:** Phase 2 decisions.

### Step 3.2 — Wait for User Input

### Step 3.3 — Generate `tasks.md`

Generate a numbered task list organized into **independent parallel groups**.
Each group has zero shared-state dependencies with other groups and can be
executed by a separate agent instance simultaneously. Within each group, tasks
are ordered sequentially.

**MANDATORY: Dependency Analysis**

Before generating `tasks.md`, analyze all tasks for:
1. File/module dependencies (does task B read/write files task A creates?)
2. API contract dependencies (does task B call an API task A defines?)
3. Infrastructure dependencies (does task B need infra task A provisions?)
4. Data dependencies (does task B need seed data or schemas from task A?)

Tasks with NO cross-dependencies form independent groups. Tasks that depend on
outputs from another group go into a later wave.

```markdown
# Tasks: <Spec Name>

## Execution Plan

| Wave | Groups (run in parallel) | Depends On |
|------|--------------------------|------------|
| 1    | Group A, Group B, Group C | —          |
| 2    | Group D, Group E          | Wave 1     |
| 3    | Group F                   | Wave 2     |

> **How to run:** Assign one worker (agent instance or developer) per group within the same wave.
> Wait for all groups in a wave to complete before starting the next wave.

---

## Wave 1 (no dependencies — start all in parallel)

### Group A: [Domain/Feature Name]
- [ ] A.1 [Task description]
- [ ] A.2 [Task description]

### Group B: [Domain/Feature Name]
- [ ] B.1 [Task description]
- [ ] B.2 [Task description]

---

## Wave 2 (depends on Wave 1 completion)

### Group D: [Domain/Feature Name]
**Requires:** Group A outputs (e.g., domain types), Group B outputs (e.g., schemas)
- [ ] D.1 [Task description]
- [ ] D.2 [Task description]

---

## Wave 3 (integration — depends on Wave 2)

### Group F: Verification & Integration
**Requires:** All prior waves complete
- [ ] F.1 End-to-end smoke test
- [ ] F.2 Update README with run / teardown instructions
```

**Task generation rules:**
- Each group targets a distinct module/boundary/feature with its own files
- Groups within the same wave MUST NOT touch the same files
- The final wave always includes integration testing and verification
- Each task is small enough to execute as a single agent request

**Task execution rules:**
- Mark each task `[x]` immediately on completion
- Follow design choices from Phase 2 — do not silently override
- Reference Phase 0 artifacts where relevant for brownfield work
- Update `aidlc-state.md` after each group completes
- A wave is complete only when ALL groups in that wave are `[x]`

### Approval Gate
Wait for explicit user approval. Update `aidlc-state.md` and `audit.md`.

---

# Task Execution

After `tasks.md` is approved, the user assigns groups to parallel workers (agent instances, developers, or a mix). For each task:

1. Execute (generate code, IaC, tests, etc.)
2. Mark the task `[x]` in `tasks.md`
3. Append progress to `aidlc-state.md`
4. Append a concise note to `audit.md`

### Parallel Execution Protocol
- Each worker (agent instance or developer) owns ONE group — only touches files within that group's boundary
- Before starting a new wave, verify all groups in the previous wave are `[x]`
- If a group finishes early, the worker waits — do NOT start next-wave tasks early
- Conflicts (two workers accidentally touching the same file) → stop, flag in audit.md, ask user

### Session Continuity During Execution
On resume:
1. Read `aidlc-state.md` for the active spec and phase
2. Read `tasks.md` for the next incomplete group/task
3. Identify which wave is active and which groups are done
4. Resume from the next incomplete task in the assigned group

### Completion
When all tasks are `[x]`:
- Present a final summary: artifacts produced, deployed resources, locations
- Mark the spec complete in `aidlc-state.md`
- Append completion entry to `audit.md`
- Ask whether to start a new spec

## Repo Model & Multi-Repo Projects

The repo model (monorepo → polyrepo) is a **decision gate** taken at project start. For multi-repo systems, capture the whole system once — **System Requirements (S1) → System High-Level Design (S2)** — then **split** those requirements into per-repo slices and fan out. The full flow — the repo-model decision gate, how the workflow adapts to each model, the two system-level passes, the split step, contract tiers and blast-radius rules, and directory conventions — lives in a dedicated steering doc to keep this workflow focused.

**MANDATORY:** Load and follow **`.kiro/steering/multi-repo-projects.md`** whenever the repo model is anything other than a single simple repo (monorepo spanning multiple contract-sharing domains, domain-grouped repos, or polyrepo). Run its **repo-model decision gate** before the design phase in every case.

---

## Key Principles

- **Phase 0 only when brownfield** — don't invent analysis for greenfield work
- **Decision-driven** — every phase starts with a `_decisions-*.md`
- **Questions in decision files**, never in chat
- **Approval gates are real** — never proceed without explicit user approval
- **Trackable** — state file + audit log + checkboxes enable session continuity
- **Multi-repo: capture whole, then split** — run System Requirements → System High-Level Design once, freeze shared contracts, then split into **derived** per-repo slices; per-repo specs consume contracts and never redefine them

---

## 🚨 FINAL REMINDER: WORKFLOW ENFORCEMENT

Every new interaction:

1. CHECK for `aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md`
2. If it exists, READ it and RESUME
3. If it doesn't exist, decide brownfield vs greenfield AND single-repo vs multi-repo, then start at the right phase (multi-repo → System Requirements → System High-Level Design → split → fan out)
4. NEVER skip a `_decisions-*.md` before the corresponding spec doc
5. NEVER skip approval gates
6. ALWAYS put questions in decision files, never in chat
7. In multi-repo work, NEVER let a per-repo spec redefine a shared contract — amend the System High-Level Design (versioned) instead

This workflow is the only workflow.
