# Web App on Cloud-Native — AI-DLC Starter Pack

A **tool-agnostic** starter pack for planning and building a **multi-tier web application** — one or more single-page apps (SPAs) fronted by their own backends-for-frontend (BFFs), talking to a shared domain service — on AWS cloud-native compute, driven by the **AI-Driven Development Lifecycle (AI-DLC)** decision-driven workflow.

The pack is authored once as tool-neutral source and works with **Kiro, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, and Cursor**. Whichever agent you use gains deep AWS expertise across compute, IaC, data, and operations, and follows structured, decision-gated workflows — no manual setup needed.

## Use case

An end-to-end **SPA + BFF** web platform: multiple frontend experiences (e.g. **Consumer / Cashier / Backoffice**), each backed by its own BFF, sharing a common **domain engine** and identity provider. A typical shape: a **Backoffice** app configures and manages the domain, a **Consumer** app drives the primary end-user journey, and a **Cashier** app handles point-of-service actions — all over one shared domain engine.

The pack is deliberately **stack-flexible**:

- **Compute** — containers (**Amazon ECS / AWS Fargate**) *or* serverless (**AWS Lambda + API Gateway**). The design phase decides which per component.
- **Data** — **Amazon Aurora** (PostgreSQL or MySQL) or **Aurora DSQL**, with an optional cache (e.g. Valkey/Redis).
- **IaC** — **Terraform / OpenTofu**, **AWS CDK**, or **CloudFormation**.
- **Identity** — bring-your-own IdP (e.g. Keycloak, Amazon Cognito).
- **Repos** — anywhere on the **monorepo → multi-repo** spectrum (single repo, workspaces, domain-grouped repos, or one repo per SPA/BFF). See [Repo model](#repo-model-monorepo--multi-repo).

It works for **greenfield** builds and **brownfield** extensions alike — when an existing codebase is present, the workflow runs a reverse-engineering pass (Phase 0) first.

## Getting started

Pick **one** of the two ways to add this pack to your project.

### Option A — copy a pre-built folder (no tooling)

Pre-generated, tool-correct configs live under [`scaffolded-packs/`](scaffolded-packs/). Copy the folder for your tool into your project root:

| Your tool | Copy from | Into your project |
|---|---|---|
| **Kiro** | `scaffolded-packs/kiro/` | `.kiro/` |
| **Claude Code** | `scaffolded-packs/claude-code/` | `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/`, `.mcp.json` |
| **GitHub Copilot** | `scaffolded-packs/copilot/` | `.github/`, `.vscode/mcp.json` |
| **Cursor** | `scaffolded-packs/cursor/` | `.cursor/` |

### Option B — generate it (installer)

Run the `ramp-pack` installer from the repo root; it reads the neutral source and writes the correct layout into your target project:

```bash
node installer/bin/ramp-pack.js init web-app-on-cloudnative --tool <kiro|claude-code|copilot|cursor> --target /path/to/your/project
```

Add `--dry-run` to preview, `--force` to overwrite existing files. Option B always works even if `scaffolded-packs/` is missing or out of date — the neutral source is the single source of truth.

### Then

1. Open the project in your tool and start a conversation. Try:
   - *"I want to build a multi-channel web platform — consumer, cashier, and backoffice apps over a shared domain engine. Let's start the AI-DLC workflow."*
   - *"This is a multi-repo project — each SPA and BFF is its own repo. Help me split the specs."*
   - *"Here's our existing domain engine repo — analyze it, then let's spec the new BFF that sits in front of it."*
   - On Claude Code / Copilot you can also run the **`/aidlc`** command to kick off the workflow.

The workflow guides the agent to ask for your decisions first (writing a `_decisions-*.md` before each spec document), and the skills provide expert-level guidance throughout.

> `instructions/`, `skills/`, and `pack.yaml` are the **neutral source** you edit. `scaffolded-packs/` is **generated** from them by the installer — regenerate it after editing the source; don't hand-edit the scaffolded output.

### How each instruction maps per tool

The neutral instructions declare a **role** (`primary` / `companion`) and a **load** rule (`always` / `auto`); the installer renders each into the target tool's native mechanism:

| Neutral role | Kiro | Claude Code | Copilot | Cursor |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `aidlc-workflow` (primary) | `.kiro/steering/*` `inclusion: always` | `CLAUDE.md` | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` `alwaysApply: true` |
| `skill-activation` (always) | `inclusion: always` | `.claude/rules/*` | `.github/instructions/*` `applyTo: '**'` | `.mdc` `alwaysApply: false` |
| `reverse-engineering` (auto) | `inclusion: auto` | `.claude/rules/*` | `.github/instructions/*` (conditional) | `.mdc` `alwaysApply: false` |
| `multi-repo-projects` (auto) | `inclusion: auto` | `.claude/rules/*` | `.github/instructions/*` (conditional) | `.mdc` `alwaysApply: false` |
| `/aidlc` command | — | `.claude/commands/aidlc.md` | `.github/prompts/aidlc.prompt.md` | — |

### Skills

Skills are curated, domain-specific knowledge bundles the agent activates on demand. This pack vendors skills across four areas — **compute**, **infrastructure-as-code**, **data**, and **operations/identity** — so it can cover both container and serverless paths. All follow the [Agent Skills open standard](https://agentskills.io/). See [Credits & attribution](#credits--attribution) for sources and licensing.

| `creating-amazon-aurora-db-cluster-with-instances` | Standing up a complete Aurora cluster + instances with Secrets Manager passwords | agent-plugins |

### MCP servers

Declared once in `pack.yaml`; the installer writes it to each tool's MCP config (`.kiro/settings/mcp.json`, `.mcp.json`, `.vscode/mcp.json`, `.cursor/mcp.json`).

| MCP Server | When the agent uses it |
|---|---|
| **AWS Knowledge** (`aws-knowledge-mcp-server`) | Documentation search, page reading, regional availability, and recommendations — used proactively when validating best practices, checking service limits, or when you question a recommendation. |

> This pack ships with just the AWS Knowledge MCP (remote, no credentials needed). The skills drive the standard CLIs (`cdk`, `cfn-lint`, `cfn-guard`, `aws`, `psql`) directly, so no service-specific MCP is required. If you want live CDK/CloudFormation resource-property validation, add the [AWS IaC MCP](https://awslabs.github.io/mcp/); for Aurora DSQL interaction, add the `awslabs.aurora-dsql-mcp-server`.

## How the workflow works

Every project is **decision-gated**: the agent writes a `_decisions-*.md`, waits for your input, then generates the matching spec document. Two shapes come out of one entry routing.

**Entry (always):**
1. Resume from `aidlc-state.md` if it exists.
2. Detect **greenfield vs brownfield**. Brownfield → run **system-level reverse-engineering first** (it feeds topology + contracts).
3. Set **spec placement** + a *provisional* mono-vs-multi lean; **defer the detailed repo topology** until after requirements.

**Single-repo / monorepo** — the standard flow, each phase gated by a `_decisions-*.md`:
```
Phase 1 Requirements → Phase 2 Design → Phase 3 Tasks (parallel waves) → execute
```

**Multi-repo (domain-grouped or polyrepo) — "capture the whole, then split":**
```
LEVEL 1 — SYSTEM (once, up front)
  S1  System Requirements    (= Phase 1, whole system)
        intent · personas · user stories + acceptance criteria ·
        units of work · cross-cutting NFRs               → approval gate
  S2  System High-Level Design   (= Phase 2, whole system)
        architecture · CONTRACT CATALOG (two-tier freeze) ·
        repo topology (unit → repo) · auth ·
        publish shared contracts = WAVE 0                → approval gate
  S3  Split — the agent decomposes S1+S2 into per-repo slices
        (the stories/ACs each repo owns + its contract obligations)  → confirm
             │
LEVEL 2 — PER REPO (fan-out, in parallel)
  S4  each repo, on its slice:  Requirements → Design → Tasks
        (derived, so substantive; per-repo decisions cover only local concerns)
  S5  contract-driven build:  Wave 0 contracts → repos build in parallel
        (contract tests) → integration wave (end-to-end across repos)
```

- **Topology is decided in S2, after S1** — it follows the bounded contexts (from RE) + overall requirements; never guessed up front.
- **State & audit are per level:** `aidlc-docs/_platform/` for the shared S0–S3 phases, and a separate `aidlc-docs/<repo>/` per sub for its S4 work — so parallel branches never collide. At **hand-off**, a squad copies its `.kiro/specs/<repo>/` + `aidlc-docs/<repo>/` into its own code repo.

**Invariants across all paths:** decision-file before every spec doc · real approval gates · **contract-first, decide-once** (per-repo specs are derived slices that consume shared contracts, never redefine them; changes routed by blast radius) · everything tracked in state + append-only audit.

## Repo model (monorepo → multi-repo)

The repo model is a **decision gate**, not a hardcoded assumption — the workflow adapts to whatever you choose, so you don't need to settle it before opening the pack. It covers the full spectrum: **monorepo**, **monorepo with workspaces** (Nx/Turborepo/Gradle), **domain-grouped repos** (e.g. `consumer`=SPA+BFF, `cashier`, `backoffice`, `engine`, `contracts`), or **repo-per-component** (polyrepo). For small, tightly-coupled teams the workflow leans toward monorepo or a few domain-grouped repos; polyrepo is reserved for many-team / compliance / independent-cadence cases.

The core risk once you split is **contract drift**: independent repos evolve APIs/types (and intent) out of sync, and per-repo specs come out thin. The workflow addresses this by **capturing the whole system once, then splitting it** — a **contract-first, decide-once** flow that applies to *every* model (only the contract *mechanism* differs: an in-repo shared package for monorepos, changed atomically; a versioned published artifact for multi-repo, changed with coordination):

1. **System-level requirements → high-level design** (run once, up front). First the **System Requirements** (the normal Phase 1, whole-system: intent, user stories + acceptance criteria, units of work, cross-cutting NFRs). Then the **System High-Level Design** (the normal Phase 2, whole-system: architecture, the **contract catalog** engine↔BFF / BFF↔SPA, **repo topology** unit→repo, auth). Shared contracts are published = **Wave 0**.
2. **Split into per-repo slices** — the agent **decomposes** the system requirements + design into each repo's slice (the user stories/ACs it owns + the contracts it consumes/publishes). Per-repo specs are **derived** from this slice, so they're substantive, not thin — and they never redefine a shared contract.
3. **Per-repo detailed specs + contract-driven parallel build** — each repo runs detailed `requirements → design → tasks` on its slice; repos build in parallel against the frozen contract (Wave 0), with an integration wave at the end.

The agent presents the repo-model gate (and, for multi-repo, spec placement and contract ownership/versioning) at project start. See the *Repo Model* and *Multi-Repo Projects* sections of `instructions/multi-repo-projects.md` for the full flow and directory conventions.

## Prerequisites

- One of: [Kiro](https://kiro.dev), [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), GitHub Copilot, or Cursor — installed and signed in.
- **Option B (installer) only:** Node.js 18+ (to run `ramp-pack`).
- `npx` available on your PATH (used to launch the AWS Knowledge MCP).
- AWS credentials configured for any local AWS operations or deploys (not needed for the AWS Knowledge MCP; the `signing-in-to-aws` skill can help via `aws login`).
