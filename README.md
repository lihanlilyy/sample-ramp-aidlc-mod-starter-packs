# AI-DLC for Modernization Starter Packs

A collection of ready-to-use, **tool-agnostic** starter packs that apply the **AI-Driven Development Lifecycle (AI-DLC)** to real-world application modernization scenarios. Each pack is a pre-configured starting point — instructions, skills, and MCP server registrations — that works with **Kiro, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, and Cursor**, so you can drop it into your own project and start a structured, decision-driven engagement immediately.

Each pack is authored once as tool-neutral source and ships pre-generated per-tool configs (plus an installer that regenerates them) — see [How to use a pack](#how-to-use-a-pack).

These packs are distilled from real modernization engagements and have been generalized for reuse. They contain no customer-identifying information.

> **Important:** This is sample code for demonstration and non-production usage. You should work with your security and legal teams to meet your organizational security, regulatory, and compliance requirements before any production deployment.

## Part of RAMP

These packs are part of the **Rapid Agentic Modernisation Program (RAMP)** — a structured engagement model that accelerates enterprise application modernisation to cloud-native architectures using agentic AI tooling. RAMP covers the full lifecycle: identifying high-impact workloads, a 2-3 day hands-on AI-DLC workshop that produces deployed output at 5-7x speed, driving those workloads to production, and scaling the methodology across the customer's portfolio.

RAMP addresses two modernisation types:

- **Transform from Legacy** — existing codebase (on-prem or EC2) converted/refactored into a cloud-native form (app + DB).
- **Reimagine and Build** — a new cloud-native system designed to replace or extend legacy, with legacy as requirements input (app + DB). Includes ERP/CRM consolidation, platform rebuilds, and brownfield extension with agentic AI.

These packs are designed for the hands-on AI-DLC for modernization workshop as part of RAMP.

## What is AI-DLC?

**AI-DLC (AI-Driven Development Life Cycle)** is an AWS methodology for building and modernizing software with AI as a central collaborator rather than a code-completion assistant. It is built on two principles: **AI-powered execution with human oversight** (the AI plans, asks clarifying questions, and defers key decisions to humans) and **dynamic team collaboration** (teams decide the things that matter while the AI does the heavy lifting). Work is organized across three phases — **Inception → Construction → Operations** — and every artifact (requirements, design, tasks, audit log) is persisted to the repository so work resumes cleanly across sessions.

These starter packs use a **streamlined, modernization-focused adaptation** of AI-DLC — the full Inception → Construction → Operations methodology condensed into a practical, decision-gated workflow:

- **Decision gates** — before the agent writes any spec document, it first produces a `_decisions-*.md` file with options and waits for your input. No assumptions, no premature code.
- **Audit trail** — every decision, approval, and rationale is appended to an audit log, producing a defensible paper trail for your architecture choices.

## How to use a pack

1. **Pick the pack** that matches your scenario from the table above.
2. **Add it to your project** in whichever agent you use — two ways:
   - **Copy a pre-built folder (no tooling):** each pack ships pre-generated configs under `<pack>/scaffolded-packs/<tool>/`. Copy the folder for your tool (`kiro`, `claude-code`, `copilot`, or `cursor`) into your project root.
   - **Generate it (installer):** run the `ramp-pack` installer from the repo root — it reads the pack's tool-neutral source and writes the correct layout into your project:
     ```bash
     node installer/bin/ramp-pack.js init <pack> --tool <kiro|claude-code|copilot|cursor> --target /path/to/your/project
     ```
3. **Read the pack's README** for the kickoff prompt and any pack-specific setup (e.g., updating an `AWS_PROFILE`, or adding Terraform tooling).
4. **Start a conversation.** The agent creates decision files first, waits for your input, then generates requirements, design, and tasks — gate by gate. On Claude Code / Copilot you can also run the **`/aidlc`** command to kick off the workflow.

Each pack's README documents its instructions, skills, MCP servers, and getting-started flow in detail.

Each tool-agnostic pack is laid out as tool-neutral source plus generated per-tool configs:

```
<pack>/
├── pack.yaml                 # Manifest: instruction roles, MCP servers, /aidlc command
├── instructions/             # Tool-neutral steering (source of truth)
├── skills/                   # Agent Skills (SKILL.md + references) — omitted for steering-only packs
└── scaffolded-packs/         # Pre-generated per-tool configs
    ├── kiro/  claude-code/  copilot/  cursor/
```

## Common building blocks

Most packs share the same AI-DLC configuration primitives, authored once in the neutral source and rendered into each tool's native location by the installer:

- **Instructions** (`instructions/*.md`) — the workflow, decision gates, and when to activate skills/MCP. Rendered per tool (Kiro `steering/` with `inclusion:`, Claude Code `CLAUDE.md` + `.claude/rules/`, Copilot `.github/copilot-instructions.md` + `.github/instructions/`, Cursor `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`).
- **Skills** (`skills/*/`) — curated, domain-specific knowledge bundles (e.g., AWS Lambda, API Gateway, Aurora DSQL) following the [Agent Skills open standard](https://agentskills.io/), copied verbatim into each tool's skills directory.
- **MCP servers** (declared in `pack.yaml`) — runtime tools the agent calls during a conversation, rendered into each tool's MCP config. The **AWS Knowledge MCP** appears in every pack for validating AWS guidance, service limits, and regional availability.

Because instructions and skills are plain Markdown, treat them as code: version them, review them, and adapt them to your own use cases.

> **Note:** `regression-software-testing` is a lightweight, steering-only pack — a set of Markdown docs you point any agent at directly; it doesn't use the installer / `scaffolded-packs` layout.

## Requirements

- One of: [Kiro](https://kiro.dev), [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), GitHub Copilot, or Cursor — installed and signed in
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/) — only if you use the `ramp-pack` installer to generate a pack (copying a pre-built `scaffolded-packs/` folder needs no Node)
- Pack-specific tools as noted in each README (e.g., an AWS profile, Terraform tooling, or `uvx`/`npx` for certain MCP servers)
